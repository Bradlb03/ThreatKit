      <h2 class="h5 mb-2">How ThreatKit handles your data</h2>
      <p class="tk-subtle mb-2">
        ThreatKit is a learning-focused security tool designed to help users understand potential risks
        in passwords, URLs, emails, and files. We treat your inputs carefully, but this tool is not a
        replacement for enterprise-grade security products.
      </p>
      <ul class="tk-subtle mb-0">
        <li>Inputs are processed for the duration of the request and are not intentionally stored in a database.</li>
        <li>We may log <strong>aggregated metadata</strong> (e.g., scores, timestamps, anonymized results) to improve the system.</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> log raw passwords, full email bodies, or uploaded files for long-term storage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="tk-subtle mb-2">
        ThreatKit partners with Microsoft Clarity to capture how you use and interact with our website 
        through behavioral metrics, heatmaps, and session replay to improve and market our products/services. 
        Website usage data is captured using first and third-party cookies and other tracking technologies to determine the
        popularity of products/services and online activity. Additionally, we use this information for site optimization, 
        fraud/security purposes, and advertising. For more information about how Microsoft collects and uses your data,

      <h2 class="h5 mb-2">Limitations & No Guarantees</h2>
      <p class="tk-subtle mb-2">
        ThreatKit uses heuristics and models to estimate risk, but no automated system is perfect.
      </p>
      <ul class="tk-subtle mb-0">
        <li>We <strong>cannot guarantee</strong> that every malicious link, file, or phishing email will be detected.</li>
        <li>A “safe” or “low risk” score does <strong>not</strong> mean the item is guaranteed to be harmless.</li>
        <li>You should always use up-to-date antivirus software and follow your organization’s security policies.</li>
        <li>ThreatKit and its developers are <strong>not responsible</strong> for any loss, damage, or incident that occurs if
            a threat is missed or misclassified by the tool.</li>

      <ul class="tk-subtle mb-0">
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> submit highly sensitive personal data (e.g., full SSNs, full credit card numbers).</li>
        <li>Do <strong>not</strong> submit regulated or confidential data that you are not allowed to share.</li>
        <li>Use the tool with sample or anonymized data when possible, especially for demos and testing.</li>

        This project is part of an educational capstone and is provided “as-is” for learning and demonstration
        purposes only. It is not a production security product and should not be relied on as your sole line of defense.
